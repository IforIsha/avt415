		<h2>Mangos</h2>
		<p> Mangoes (Mangifera indica) are among the oldest cultivated fruits in the world, with their origins tracing back over 4,000 years to South Asia, particularly India, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. They were considered sacred in ancient India, often associated with love, prosperity, and fertility, and even mentioned in Hindu and Buddhist texts. Buddhist monks are believed to have spread mango seeds to other parts of Asia around the 4thâ€“5th century BCE.  </p>

		<h2>Nail Polish</h2>
		<p> Nail polish dates back to around 3000 BCE in China, where it was made from ingredients like beeswax, egg whites, and natural dyes, with colors often signifying social class. Ancient Egyptians also used henna to color their nails, with shades symbolizing status. Modern nail polish as we know it was developed in the 1920s, inspired by automobile paint, leading to the glossy, colorful lacquers widely used today.  </p>


		<h2>Pickles</h2>
		<p> Pickles have been around for over 4,000 years, with origins traced to Mesopotamia, where cucumbers were first preserved in brine. They later spread to ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, valued for their taste and long shelf life. Over time, different cultures developed their own pickling methods, making them both a food staple and a method of preservation worldwide. </p>
